#### Sources
The data was collected from:
1. Web pages:  
   1.1. [a selection of quotes from Radio Svaboda](https://www.svaboda.org/a/24255332.html)  
1.2. [selection from the National library website](https://www.nlb.by/by/infarmatsyynyya-resursy/elektronnyya-infarmatsyynyya-resursy/resursy-natsyyanalnay-bibliyateki-belarusi/virtualnyya-praekty-vysta-ki-i-kalektsyi/virtualnyya-praekty-bibliyateki/klasiki-susvetnay-litaratury-yanka-kupala-i-yakub-/vyslo-i-vykazvanni-afaryzmy-belaruskikh-pesnyaro )

2.2. [Ales Zaika. Proverbs and sayings from Kosovchyna](https://knihi.com/Ales_Zajka/Prykazki_i_prymauki_z_Kosauscyny.html )

#### Why these particular resources?

I wanted to start somewhere. I found a certain number of quotes on websites. But it seemed insufficient, so I decided to look at the books again. I chose the first ones that fit the content. 
Getting something out of books is quite difficult, so for now I have limited myself to these two.
The complexities of parsing and reading from pdf can be seen in [this notebook](pdf_quotes_scraping.ipynb).
